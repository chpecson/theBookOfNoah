  -server project

-In the traditional server-rendered web application, the client computer makes a request 'for' a web page. The server creates and returns a page to the client. Finally, the client loads the new page and displays the information. If they interact with the page, say to add or remove something by submitting a form, they start the cycle all over again. The client will make another request, the server returns a totally new page, the client loads and presents it to the user again.

-server vs client apps
  .highly interactive apps are better 'for' client side apps
  .apps that dont change/update/respond to interactions are better as server side apps

-single page applications
  .self contained page that has its own user 'interface' and logic, can talk to the server, store it locally, and immediately interact with the data doing CRUD

-MVC: design pattern 'for' structuring app
  .model: data model: everything a user
  .view: what the user sees, any html, css, or javascript
  .controller: brain of the application, sits between model and view and in charge of passing data between them
-frameworks: created because some projects require the same boilerplate
  .allows developers to focus on the brain of their app, without worrying about the lower level details
  .are 'for' end-to-end app development
  .characteristics
-coding principles:
  .kiss: keep it simple
  .dry: dont repeat yourself
