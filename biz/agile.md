# terminology
  - project inception: One of the key objectives of a project inception is to collect requirements collaboratively.
  - Story mapping: is an engaging activity where all participants are involved in the process of building the product backlog on a wall, versus writing a dull 100-page requirement document.
    -  tool to capture requirements during inception
    - process : vision -> goals > activites -> tasks
      1. define the project vision:
      2. define goals required to achieve vision
      3. define activities required to reach each goal
      4. define tasks/stories required to reach each activity
    - process: User > Goals > User Journeys > Actions > Stories.
    - process: NFR > Requirement > Story.
      - nfr: non functional requirement
