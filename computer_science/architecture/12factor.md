		1. use declarative formats for setup automation to minimize time and cost for new developers joining the project
		2. have a clean contract with the underlying operating system offering maximum portability between execution environments
		3. are suitable for deployment on modern cloud platforms obviating the need for servers and systems adminsitration
		4. minimmize divergence between development and production enabling continuous deployment for maximum agility
		5. can sclae up without significant changes nto tooling, architecture or development practices
