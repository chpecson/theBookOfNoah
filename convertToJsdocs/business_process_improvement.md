Business Process  Improvement: BPI
steps
identify the process to be improved (Based on a critical business issue):
can be a formal or formal exercise
can be selected by using a set of criteria derived from strategic or tactical priorities
can be selected based on performance gabs
only select those processes with the greatest impact on a competitive advantage or customer requirement
develop objectives for the project based on the requirements of the process
quality improvement
productivity
cost
customer service
cycle time
the goal is always to get the process under control
select the members of the cross-functional team:
horizontal analysis is carried out by a team composed of representatives of all functions involved in the process
a consultant/in-house staff can do the job, but a team composed of a cross-functional membership will have a greater quality of analysis and commitment
document the current process:
use a flow chart and/or organization map
describe the process at the organization level
describe the process at the process level
describe the process at the job/performer level
develop a cross-functional process map for the process
identify "disconnects" in the process
disconnects: anything that inhibit the efficiency and effectiveness of the process
at the organization level
at the process level
at the job/performer level
recommend changes:
at the organization, process, or execution (job/performer) level
categorize and prioritize the main problems and possibilities
evaluate alternative solutions
develop a cross-functional process map for the recommended process
establish process and sub-process measures
all measures should reflect the objectives of the project
implement the approved strategy
elements of successful implementation effort
executive leadership and management commitment
clear statement of why the change is necessary
clear vision of how the organization will be different after the changes
comprehensive recommendations
comprehensive implementation strategy and plan
adequate resources and time
communication of plans, roles and responsibilities, benefits, progress, resolutions
willingness of affected functions and individuals to support the proposed changes
implementation is effectively managed and executed
ongoing process improvement and management (PI&M)
monitoring process performance against customer-driven process measures
certifying the process (ensuring it meets a set of effectiveness criteria)
appointing a process owner who is responsible on an ongoing basis for process performance)
ensuring that the process has a plan and a budget
create a reward system which encourages process effectiveness
managing the space between functions
Business Process Discovery
BPD: related to process mining; a set of techniques that automatically construct a representation of an organization's current business processes and its major process variations using evidence found in the existing technology systems that run business processes within an organization
techniques
Emergent paradigm: current methods are based on top-down structured manual interviews relying on second-hand representations of the business process/system behaviors
collecting data from the information system over a period of time
analyze the data to form a process model
automated process discovery: by automating the analysis of data, the subjectivity of current manual process analysis techniques is removed
accurate information: since the information is collected from the actual source it cannot be inaccurate; as opposed to gathering it form second party representation
complete information: an automated process captures all the information that is occurring within the system and represents them by time, date, user, etc.
info is collected from real-time interactions
standardized process: automated collection of information yields process data which can be grouped, quantified and classified; provides a basis for the development and monitoring of both current and new processes to which benchmarks can be assigned
application /techniques
process discovery is one of three types of process mining (+conformance checking, +model extension/enhancement)
all techniques aim at extracting process related knowledge from event logs
process discovery : there is no prior process model; the model is discovered based on event logs
conformance checking: finding differences between a given process model and event log; thus its possible to quantify compliance and analyze discrepancies
model extension/enhancement: takes a prior model and improves/extends it using information from the event log (e.g. removing bottlenecks)
business process discovery: the next level of understanding in the emerging field of  business analytics
business analytics: allows organizations to view, analyze and adjust the underlying structure and processes that go into day-to-day operations
discovery: includes information gathering of all the components of a business process
business process components: technology, people, department procedures, department protocols
Business process analysis: tools and methodologies suited for top-down hierarchical process decomposition, and analysis of to-be processes
BPD: Business Process Discovery: provides a bottoms-up  analysis that marries the top-down to provide a complete business process, organized hierarchically by BPA
Business Intelligence: provides organizations with reporting and analytics on the data in their organizations
BI has no process model, awareness or analytics, BPD complements BI by providing an explicit process view to current operations, and providing analytics on that process model to help organizations identify and act upon business process inefficiencies or anomalies
Web analytics: limited example of BPD in that web analytics reconstructs the web-user's process as they interact with a web-site. however, these analytics are limited to the process as its contained within the session, from the users perspective and with respect to just the web-based  system and process
business triage: provides a framework for categorizing the processes identified by BPA (business process analysis) based on their relative importance to achieving a stated, measurable goal or outcome; utilizes the same categories employed by military medical and disaster medical services, business processes are categorized as:
essential/critical (red process): process essential for achieving outcomes/goals
important/urgent (yellow process): process which speeds achieving outcomes/goals
optional/support (green process):  process not needed to achieve outcomes/goals
resources are allocated based on the process category with resources first dedicated to red processes, then yellow processes and finally green processes
in the event resources are limited, they are withheld first from green processes, then yellow processes,
resources are only withheld from red processes if failure to achieve outcomes/goals is acceptable
Process Modeling
process models: processes of the same nature that are classified together into a model; i.e. a description of a process at the type level
since the process model is at the type (of process) level, a process is an instantiation of it.
the same process model is used repeatedly for the development of many applications and thus, has many instantiations
is an anticipation of what the process will look like; what the process shall be will be determined during actual system development
addresses the process aspects of an enterprise business architecture, leading to an all encompassing enterprise architecture
i.e. the relationships of a business process in the context of the rest of the enterprise systems, data organizational structures, strategies, etc.
process model goals:
descriptive
track what actually happens during a process
take the point of view of an external observer who looks at the way a process has been performed and determines the improvements that must be made to make it perform more effectively or efficiently
prescriptive
define the desired processes and how they should/could/might be performed
establish rules, guidelines, and behavior patterns which, if followed, would lead to the desired process performance
can range from strict enforcement to flexible guidance
explanatory
provide explanations about the rationale of processes
explore and evaluate the several possible courses of action based on rational arguments
establish an explicit link between processes and the requirements that the model needs to fulfill
pre-defines points at which data can be extracted for reporting purposes
purpose
meta-process modeling: explains the key concepts needed to describe what happens in the development process, on what, when it happens, and why
aimed at providing guidance for method engineers and application developers
the activity of 'modeling a business' process usually predicates a need to change processes/identify issues to be corrected
change management: programs designed to put processes into practice
classification of process models
by coverage
activity oriented: related set of activities conducted for the specific purpose of product definition; a set of partially ordered steps intended to reach a  goal
product-oriented: series of activities that cause sensitive product transformations to reach the desired product
decision-oriented: set of related decisions conducted for the specific purpose of product definition
context-oriented: sequence of contexts causing successive product transformations  under the influence of a decision taken in a context
strategy-oriented: allow building models representing multi-approach a process and plan different possible ways to elaborate the product based on the notion of intention and strategy
by alignment: process can be of different kinds, and correspond to the various ways in a which a process can be modelled
strategic processes:
investigate alternative ways of doing a thing and eventually produce a plan for doing it
often creative and require human cooperation; alternate generation and selection from an alternative are very critical activities
tactical processes
help in the achievement of a plan
more concerned with the tactics to be adopted for actual plan achievement than with the development of a plan of achievement
implementation processes
are the lowest level processes
directly concerned with the details of the what and how of plan implementation
by granularity: the level of detail of a process model and affects the kind of guidance, explanation and trace that can be provided
course granularity: restricts these to a rather limited level of detail
suitable for the project manager, generals, top-level, corporate, sometimes middle management;
these individuals want to gain an overview of time, budget and resource planning
fine granularity: provides more detailed capability
suitable for engineers, users, testers, analysts, system architects
these individuals will prefer a fine grained process model where the details of the model can provide them with instructions and important execution dependencies such as dependencies between people
by flexibility: while process models were prescriptive, in actual practice/implementation departures from the prescription can occur
organize method construction in a flexibility spectrum ranging from low to high
low: rigid methods, strict controls, operator has low empowerment; processes that are completely pre-defined and leave little scope for adapting them to the situation at hand
high: modular methods that can be modified and augmented to fit a given situation
quality of methods (modeling techniques)
expressiveness: the degree to which a given modeling technique is able to denote the models of any number and kinds of application domains
arbitrariness: the degree of freedom one has when modeling one and the same domain
suitability: the degree to which a given modeling technique is specifically tailored for a specific kind of application domain
comprehensibility: the ease with which the way of working and way of modeling are understood by participants
coherence: the degree to which the individual sub models of a way of modeling constitute a whole
completeness: the degree to which all necessary concepts of the application domain are represented in the way of modeling
efficiency: the degree to which the modeling process uses resources such as time and people
effectiveness: the degree to which the modeling process achieves its goal
business process reengineering
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_reengineering
business process reengineering: a business management strategy; focusing on the analysis and design of workflows and business processes within an organization
aims to help organizations fundamentally rethink how they do their work in order to dramatically improve customer service, cut operational costs, and become world class competitors
aims to radically restructure their organizations by focusing on the ground up design of their business processes
emphasizes a holistic focus on business objectives and how processes related to them, encouraging full scale recreation of processes rather than iterative optimization of sub-processes
aka: business process redesign; business transformation; business process change management
business process: set of logically related tasks performed to achieve a defined business outcome
overview
BPR: business process reengineering is the practice of rethinking and redesigning the way work is done to better support an organization's mission and reduce costs
focuses on the organization's business processes:
the steps and procedures that govern how resources are used to create products and services that meet the needs of particular customers/markets
structured ordering of work steps across time and place, that can be decomposed into specific activities, measured, modeled, and improved
can be completely redesigned or eliminated altogether
identifies, analyzes, and redesigns an organization's core business processes with the aim of achieving dramatic improvements in critical performance measures
measures: cost, quality, service, speed
recognizes that an organization's business processes are usually fragmented into sub-processes and tasks that are carried out by several specialized functional areas with no single person responsible for the entire process (only sub-processes)
optimizing the performance of sub-processes can result in some benefits but cannot yield dramatic improvements if the process itself is fundamentally inefficient and outmoded
thus, BPR focuses on redesigning the process as a whole in order to achieve the greatest possible benefits to the organization and their customers
business process improvement: focuses on incremental improvement
business process reengineering: focuses on radical redesign
BPR major areas
Organization
Reflects the structural elements of the company, i.e. hierarchical levels, composition of organization units, and the distribution of work between them
Technology
Concerned with the use of computer systems and other forms of communication technology in the organization
Strategy
Business strategy is the primary drive of BPR initiatives and the other dimensions are governed by strategy’s encompassing role
People
Deals with aspects of education, training, motivation and reward systems
Business Processes: the unifying framework connecting the previous four areas
The interrelated activities aimed at creating a value added output to a customer; the basic underlying idea of BPR
Characteristics of a business process: process ownership, customer focus, value adding, cross-functionality
Areas to reengineer:
Organizational structures
Management systems
Employee responsibilities and performance measurements
Incentive systems
Skills development
Use of IT
history
instead of using technology to automate work, use technology to obliterate work that does not add-value, and to increase efficiency and effectiveness of work that does add-value
definitions
the fundamental rethinking and radical redesign of business processes to achieve dramatic improvements in critical contemporary modern measures of performance, e.g. cost, quality, service, and speed
encompasses the envisioning of new work strategies, the actual process design activity, and the implementation of the change in all its complex technological, human and organizational dimensions
OD: organizational development, includes TQM, Continuous improvement, and BPR, among others
Role of information technology
Information technology is conserved as the major enabler for new forms of working and collaborating within an organization and across organizational borders
Shared databases: makes information available at many places
Expert systems: allowing generalists to perform specialist tasks
Telecommunication networks: allows organizations to be centralized and decentralized at the same time
Decision-support tools: allowing decision-making to be part of everybody’s job
Wireless data communication & portable computers: allows field personnel to work office independent
steps to BPR
assessment of:
organization's mission
 organization's strategic goal
 customer needs
top questions to ask:
does mission need to be redefined?
are our strategic goals aligned with our mission?
who are our customers?
what are their wants and needs?
Select BPR team: makes key decisions and recommendations and communicates the details and benefits of the BPR program to the entire organization
Competency of team members
Credible team members
Specific team member goals
Team composition: top management, members of involved with the BP under consideration, IT groups, finance, customers (if possible)
Business Analysis: assess the current processes and determine what exactly needs to be reengineered
Hold sessions with process owners and stakeholders: determine goals, objectives, conceptualize the ideal BP; build a business process model
Identifying specific problem areas
Solidifying goals: each goal should be linked back to key business objectives and the overall strategic direction for the organization
Should show the thread from the top to the bottom of the organization, so each person can easily connect the overall business direction with the reengineering effort
Developing a business vision and process objectives relies on a clear underlying of organizational strengths, weaknesses, and market structure, and awareness and knowledge about innovative activities undertaken by competitors and other organizations
Defining business objectives
Out of sync steps (place somewhere above)
Change management plan
Considerations
Business Process Reengineering Cycle
Identify Processes
Review, update, analyze as-is
Design to-be
Test & implement to-be
Process analysis checklist
Reduce handoffs
Centralize data
Reduce delays
Free resources faster
Combine similar activities
BPR success factors
BPR team composition
Business needs analysis
Adequate IT infrastructure
Effective Change management
Ongoing continuous improvement
Top management sponsorship
Buy-in from process users
Budget allocation
Business Process Failures
One department optimized at the expense of another
Lack of time to focus on improving business process
Lack of recognition of the extent of business problems
Lack of training
People involved use the best tool at their disposal, which may not be the best tool for the job
Inadequate infrastructure
Overly bureaucratic processes
Lack of motivation
Change management
Change management: the discipline of managing change as a process, with due consideration that employees are people, not programmable machines
Involves all human and social related changes and cultural adjustment techniques needed by management to facilitate the insertion of newly designed processes and structures into working practice and to deal effectively with resistance
Change is implicitly driven by motivation which is fueled by the recognition of the need for change
Organizational culture: determining factor in successful BPR implementation; influences the organization’s ability to adapt to change
Culture: self-reinforcing set of believes, attitudes and behavior; one of the most resistant elements of organizational behavior and extremely difficult to change
Steps:
Convey an understanding of the necessity for change; management rewards system, stories of company origin and early successes of founders, physical symbols and company icons constantly enforce the message of the current culture
Ongoing continuous improvement
BPR is a successive and ongoing process and should be regarded as an improvement strategy
Continuous improvement: the propensity of the organization to pursue incremental and innovative improvements in its processes, products, and services
Other incremental change is governed by the knowledge gained from each previous change cycle
The automation infrastructure of the BPR activity must provide performance measurements in order to support continuous improvements
It must efficiently capture and appropriate data and allow access to appropriate individuals
BPR processes must be tested before it is deployed to the end users
There must be proactive feedback mechanism that provides for and facilities resolutions of problems and issues
Other definitions
Process Architecture: the structural design of general process systems; can be viewed as a dualistic relationship of its infrastructure and superstructure
Infrastructure: describes a process system’s component parts and their interactions
Suprastructure: considers the super system of which the process system is part
Black box requirements:  come from the suprastructure;
White box requirements: e.g. engineering rules, programming syntax, etc. come from the process system’s infrastructure
Processes: having inputs, outputs and the energy required to transform inputs to outputs
Workflow: consists of an orchestrated and repeatable pattern of business activity enabled by the systematic organization of resources into processes that transform materials, provide services, or process information
Can be depicted as a sequence of operations, declared s work of a person/group, an organization of staff, or one/more simple/complex mechanisms
Input description: the information, material and energy required to complete the step
Transformation rules, algorithms, which may be carried out by associated human roles or machines, or a combination
Output description: the information, material and energy produced by the step and provided as input to downstream steps
Components can only be plugged together if the output of one previous (set of ) component(s) is equal to the mandatory input requirements of the following component
