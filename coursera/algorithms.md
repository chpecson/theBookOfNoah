# questions
  - naive solution
  - Integer Overflow: a number that exceeds the limits, e.g. in C++ a large number as 9,000,000,000 does not fit into the standard C++ int type (on most modern machines, it ranges from âˆ’2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647).
  - stress test: e.g. inputting a large data set to test an algorithms capability to handle it
# NOTES
  - modern machines can perform roughly 109 basic operations per second (this depends on a machine of course, but 109 is a reasonable average estimate).
# background

# testing
  - A few small manual tests.
  - A test for each possible type of answer (smallest answer, biggest answer, answer doesn't exist, etc.)
  - Test for time/memory limit: generate a test with the largest possible size of input ("max test"), run your program, measure time and memory consumption.
  - Tests for corner cases:
    + Smallest possible "n": the length of the input sequence or string, the number of queries, etc.
    + Equal numbers, equal letters in the string, more generally, equal objects in the input. Any two objects that are not restricted to be different in the problem statement can be equal.
    + Largest numbers in the input allowed by the problem statement - for example, to test for integer overflow.
    + Degenerate cases like empty set, three points on one line, a tree which consists of just one chain of nodes.
## stress testing
  - The idea behind stress testing is that:
    + if: you have two correct solutions, and the answer to the problem is unique, then for any possible test case they are guaranteed to give the same answer.
    + If: however, at least one of the solutions is incorrect, then with very high probability there exists a test on which their answers differ.
    + The only case when it is not so is when there is a common mistake in both solutions, but that is very unlikely (unless the mistake is somewhere in the input/output routines which are common to both solutions - check for that separately).
    + if one solution is correct and the other is wrong, then there obviously exists a test case on which they differ.
    + If both are wrong, but the bugs are different, then most probably there exists a test on which one solution gives a correct answer and another gives wrong answer, so they differ.
  1. The solution you want to test.
  2. A different, possibly trivial and very slow, but easy to implement and obviously correct solution to the problem.
  3. A test generator.
  4. An infinite loop in which a new test is generated, it is fed into both solutions, then the results are compared, and if they differ, the test and both answers are output, and the program stops, otherwise the loop repeats.
## testing best practices:
  - It is very important to write programs that work correctly on all the allowed inputs.
  - Testing is essential to writing correct programs.
  - First test on a few small manual tests, then test for each type of answer, then test on large test cases for time limit and memory limit, then test on corner cases.
  - After that, apply stress testing to ensure your program works - it will almost always lead to correct solution. You can do it before your first attempt to submit your solution - and will often get it right from the first attempt!
  - Stress testing consists of implementing the intended solution, another simple possible slow solution, a test generator and an infinite loop which generates tests and compares answers of the two solutions.
  - Always try to find the smallest test cases on which your solution fails.
Try different regions of the test space when generating cases for stress testing.
