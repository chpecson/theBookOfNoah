# research
  - User-defined types
  - Table inheritance
  - Sophisticated locking mechanism
  - Foreign key referential integrity
  - Views, rules, subquery
  - Nested transactions (savepoints)
  -
  - Asynchronous replication
  - Tablespaces
  - Point-in-time recovery

# terminology
  - PostgreSQL: general purpose and object-relational database management system, the most advanced open source database system
    - allows you to add custom functions developed using different programming
    - define your own data types, index types, functional languages, etc.
    - develop a custom plugin to enhance it to meet your requirements e.g., adding a new optimizer.
  - Multi-version concurrency control (MVCC):
    - known as snapshot isolation in Oracle

# server and db objects
  - server service: You can install multiple PostgreSQL servers on a physical server using different ports and having different locations to store data.
  - database: container of other objects such as tables, views, functions, indexes, etc
  - table: used to store the data
  - table inheritance: a table (child table) can inherit from another table (parent table) so when you query data from the child table, the data from parent table is also showing up.
  - schema: logical container of tables and other objects inside a database.
    - Each PostgreSQL database may have multiple schemas.
  - tablespace:  where PostgreSQL stores the data
    - enables you to move your data to different physical location across drivers easily by using simple commands.
    - pg_default: for storing userâ€™s data
    - pg_global: for storing system data.
  - view: a virtual table that is used to simplify complex queries and to apply security for a set of records.
    - updatable views:
  - function:  a block reusable SQL code that returns a scalar value of a list of records
  - operator:  a symbolic function.
  - cast: enable you to convert one data type into another data type.
    - You can also create your own casts to override the default casting provided by PostgreSQL.
  - sequence:  used to manage auto-increment columns that defined in a table as a serial column.
  - extension:  wrap other objects including types, casts, indexes, functions, etc into a single unit.
    -  The purpose of extensions is to make it easier to maintain.
  - subquery: a query nested inside another query, e.g. in the where clause with the in operator

## select
  - Select distinct rows by using `DISTINCT` operator.
  - Filter rows by using `WHERE` clause.
  - Sort rows by using `ORDER` BY clause.
  - Select rows based on various operators such as `BETWEEN`, `IN` and `LIKE`.
  - Group rows into groups using `GROUP BY` clause
  - Apply conditions for groups using `HAVING` clause.
  - Join a table to other tables using `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `FULL OUTER JOIN`, `CROSS JOIN` clauses.
  - To construct a subquery, we put the second query in brackets and use it in the WHERE clause as an expression

### retrieval
  ```sh
    # basic retrieval
      select * from tablename;
      select col1, col2 from tablename;
      select distint col1 from tablename;
      select distinct col1, col2 from tablename; # distinct applies to combination of column values
      select distinct on (col1) col2 from tablename order by col1; # returns first distinct value of each group. order by col must be the distinct on col. the distinct on col value is not returned but you can list it twice
      select distinct on (col1) col1, col2 from tablename order by col1;
      select * from tablename order by col asc|desc;

    # filtering
      # basic structure
        select * from tablename where CONDITIONS order by col limit N offset M
          #limit = max records
          #order by = must be used whenever using LIMIT
          #offset = skip X records before selecting
      # common conditions
        col1 = 'some string' and col2 = 'other thing';
        col1 NOT BETWEEN low AND high;
        col1 < low OR value > high; # same as above
        col1 between lowvalue and highvalue;
        col1 >= lowvalue and col1 <= highvalue; #same as above
        col <= 1 or col >= 0;
        col1 in (this, list, of, values)
        col1 not in (this, list, of, values)
        col1 <> (same, as, above)
        col in (select colX from tablename)
      # common pattern matching conditions
        col like 'blah%'; # % match any sequence of characters
        col like 'bl_h'; # match any single character
        col not like 'bl_h';
        first_name LIKE '_her%';
          'foo' LIKE 'foo'; # true
          'foo' LIKE 'f%'; # true
          'foo' LIKE '_o_'; # true
          'bar' LIKE 'b_'; # false
        first_name ILIKE 'BAR%'; # case insensitive

  ```
### builtin functions
  ```sh
    select avg (col) from tablename;
  ```

### sub queries
  - First, executes the subquery.
  - Second, gets the result and passes it to the outer query.
  - Third, executes the outer query.
  ```sh
    # basic subquery
      select * from tablename where col > (
        select avg (col2) from othertablename
      );

    # retrieve rows that return true via the exist operator
      select * from tablename where exists (
        select 1 from tablename where CONDITIONS
      );
  ```

# tables
  -
  ```sh
    create table tablename (
      col1 TYPE keyword1 keyword2 keywordX,
      col2 etc,
      colX etc
    );

    insert into tablename (col1, colX)
    values
      (col1Value, colXValue),
      (col1Value, colXValue),
      (col1Value, colXValue);
  ```
