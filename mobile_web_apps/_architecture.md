  - developer agility
  - iterate quickly
  - dev workflows
  - developer experience
  - isolation for security
  - operational audit
  - operational resource quotas (e.g. cost of server per dev per blah blah blah)
# principles
  - deployments should be consistent, deploying to dev should be the same as deploying to prod
  - adding resources should be immediately available to other resources in that environment
  - every hook for every action should be validated by your policy
# 12 factor
  - how a modern application should be designed so that its decoupled from its parts
  - best practices about an application's concerns and decoupling them so that deploying to different environments is seamless
## principles
  - use distributed data stores so that multiple instances of your application can use that data
  - can scale horizontally
  - environment provides metadata required for application
## general guidelines
  - application should never save state

# container based applications
  - a way to encapsulate your application in an file so that you can deploy them anywhere

# operational concerns

# security concerns

# reusability
