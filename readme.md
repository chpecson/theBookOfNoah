# why are we here?
  - engineering is the wild wild west, especially at this juncture in my career.
    + this quarter its all about relational dbs, next quarter its all about nosql,
    + how about I do it in  django? yeah 6 months later lets re write it in react
  - these notes help me switch contexts and ramp up to that of my peers
