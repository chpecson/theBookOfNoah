# [Cross-site scripting (XSS)]
  - is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in web applications.
  - XSS enables attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
  - A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy.

# [SQL injection]

# [same origin policy]
  - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy)
  - the same-origin policy is an important concept in the web application security model. Under the policy, a web browser permits scripts contained in a first web page to access data in a second web page, but only if both web pages have the same origin. An origin is defined as a combination of URI scheme, hostname, and port number. This policy prevents a malicious script on one page from obtaining access to sensitive data on another web page through that page's Document Object Model.
